# Odoo Operator 

(leveraging Red Hat's [operator-framework](https://github.com/operator-framework))

Run OdooInstances professionally at scale

This is in early alpha. If you find this interesting, please star/watch to keep updated. We expect to iterate very rapidly until reaching beta in the coming days/week.


Feedback is especially welcome through opening an issue if you want to discuss some resource definition primitives.

Please consult `pgk/apis/odoo/v1alpha1` for resource defintion.
